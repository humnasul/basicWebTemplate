# basicWebTemplate
a basic website template using html, css, javascript - made using repl.it  
Includes 1 button that leads to a new page with 6 buttons that make different text appear  
*** disclaimer: I would normally make it so clicking each of the 6 buttons takes you to a new page with text to prevent any issues, but I wanted to experiment with the none/block display option for showing info - the first button click takes you to a new page so that idea is also included!
